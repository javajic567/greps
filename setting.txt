A Django settings file contains all the configuration of your Django installation. This document explains how settings work and which settings are available.

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['www.example.com']
DEBUG = False
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'webmaster@example.com'


Note

If you set DEBUG to False, you also need to properly set the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting.

A settings file is just a Python module with module-level variables. 



It doesnâ€™t allow for Python syntax errors.

It can assign settings dynamically using normal Python syntax. For example:

MY_SETTING = [str(i) for i in range(30)]
It can import values from other settings files.
